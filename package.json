  "description": "This is a bridge establishing interoperability between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic in a trustless, low-cost way. Instead of relaying block headers from one chain to the other, it uses a trustless Custodian who verifies transactions across the two chains.  The bridge architecture consists of five main components, which are simply symmetrically replicated to get a two-way bridge.",
